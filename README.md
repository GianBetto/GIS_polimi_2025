# GIS - Laboratory 2025
Air pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the air, including gases and particulates, that can negatively
impact human health and the environment. The main sources of air pollution include industrial emissions, vehicle
exhaust, burning of fossil fuels, agricultural activities, and natural events like wildfires and volcanic eruptions. These
pollutants contribute to climate change, respiratory diseases, and environmental degradation.

Throughout the GIS laboratory students will harness the availability of free and open geospatial data (e.g.,
Copernicus) to study the historical trends of air pollutants (e.g., NO2, PMs) in relation to environmental variables (e.g.,
Land cover) and evaluate exceedance above the recommended guidelines. Main steps in developing the lab will be
carried out using standard GIS techniques for data preprocessing, processing and advanced visualization techniques.
The results will be presented through a WebGIS, accompanied by a dedicated webpage that includes a brief
description of the laboratory and key findings.
